# React + Vite

This is a smaller web application using Vite and SASS. This is so I can work on file and folder structure during a project as well as using objects and passing them down as props so that my return statements are not bogged down with JSX and can be a DRY as possible; More updates to follow;

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
