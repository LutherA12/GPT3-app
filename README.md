# React + Vite

This is a smaller web application using Vite and SASS. This is so I can work on file and folder structure during a project as well as using objects and passing them down as props so that my return statements are not bogged down with JSX and can be a DRY as possible; More updates to follow;

09/09/23 update: I've just completed a few more components; I'm using objects and the map() in order to again keep my code as DRY as possible; I'm also leveraging SASS to a greater effect as nesting css helps cut down on typing time; As stated before this is a smaller project and should not take much more time to complete dependent upon my other projects of course; More updates to follow; 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
