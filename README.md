# React + Vite

As stated, I am using Vite for this React application. This is another project I'm working to understand how to better use Vite, SASS (scss), and organization of file and folder structure as a whole during projects. I'm also working on using objects in my code so that my return statements for each function are not bogged down with strings as well as being DRY; More updates to follow;

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
