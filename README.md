# React + Vite
#GPT3 a smaller web landing page that can be customized;

This is a smaller web application using Vite and SASS. This is so I can work on file and folder structure during a project as well as using objects and passing them down as props so that my return statements are not bogged down with JSX and can be a DRY as possible; More updates to follow;

09/09/23 update: I've just completed a few more components; I'm using objects and the map() in order to again keep my code as DRY as possible; I'm also leveraging SASS to a greater effect as nesting css helps cut down on typing time; As stated before this is a smaller project and should not take much more time to complete dependent upon my other projects of course; More updates to follow; 

09/10/23 update: I've completed phase 1 of this web application; This is a full landing page that can be changed up to meet the needs of any clientele; There is no functionality yet in terms of links and buttons as well as no Database behind it, however, those can be easily implemented if need be; This will be the final update for now, but there will be more applications to come; I've streamlined everything into objects (and arrays) and used placeholders in my JSX. I've used SASS and tried to keep my code as DRY as possible; I was able to use the map() and was able to employ the useState(), but only for the drop down menu for mobile use of this application;
